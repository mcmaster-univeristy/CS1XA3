# CS1XA3

Project1:
	for this project, I select all the features.
	
	Instruction for using the script:
	
	In order to performance some features, the user need to  use 
	the command line such as: ./script Num, where Num is the number 
	in front of the features.

	For example, if the user want to execute the feature of Creating a TODO
	log, he needs to type ./script 1
	
	Features that the script provide: 
	 1.Create a TODO log:
	   TODO	log contains each line of every file in my Repo.

	 2.Complie Error Log:
	   Collect all the haskell and python files that failed to complie.

	 3.Merge Log:
	   Find all the commit hashes where merge is mentioned in the commit
           message and put them in a file merge.log.
  
         4.File Type Count:
	   For each HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Haskell and Bash Script 
           file: output a file count for how many of each exist.  

         5.Delete Temporary Files:
	   Find and delete all UNTRACKED (and untracked only) files ending 
           in the extension .tmp.
	
	 6.Find Last Working Files:
	   For a file given by user input, find the last working version 
	   (i.e no syntax errors) and checkout and merge that file to the 
	   current branch. If no working version exists, keep the most 
           current version.
